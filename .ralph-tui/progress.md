# Ralph Progress Log

This file tracks progress across iterations. Agents update this file
after each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.

## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)

*Add reusable patterns discovered during development here.*

### Documentation Structure
- Two-layer approach: Topic index docs (root `docs/README.md`) + deep-dive docs (subfolder `*/README.md`)
- Navigation table in index doc helps users locate relevant documentation quickly
- Each subfolder contains its own index README with "Contents" and "Related" sections

## 2026-02-28 - US-001
- Created `docs/README.md` as canonical docs entrypoint with navigation table
- Created folder structure: docs/architecture, docs/ui, docs/state, docs/hooks, docs/providers, docs/contributing
- Created index README.md files in each folder for topic navigation
- **Learnings:**
  - Two-layer docs structure: topic index docs (root) + deep-dive docs (subfolders)
  - Navigation table in README helps users find relevant docs quickly
